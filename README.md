# rProtocols
A protocol is a living pattern of interaction: a transparent and adaptable way of doing something, shared publicly so others may use, fork, or evolve it. Like recipes or trails, protocols are shared guides that others can follow, remix, or evolveâ€”not commandments, but starting points for action.
It expresses intentions, steps, roles, tools, and the needs it serves. It is not a rule or agreement, but an open experiment that fosters collaboration through voluntary alignment.
