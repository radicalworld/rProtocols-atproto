# rProtocols

**rProtocols** are living, open protocols for collaboration — transparent, adaptable ways of working that evolve through collective experimentation rather than static rules.
They help individuals, teams, and communities create alignment without control, building a foundation for a **Life-serving**, peer-to-peer economy.

A protocol in this context is **not just technical** — it’s social, organizational, and experimental.
Each protocol defines how something is done, why it exists (the need it serves), and how it can adapt through feedback and iteration.
Protocols can be adopted, forked, and evolved openly — like recipes, trails, or open-source software — forming an ecosystem of shared learning.

## 🌍 Part of the Radical World Ecosystem

**Radical World** is a collaborative experiment to reimagine how we organize, work, and create — moving from a Story Lens based on ownership and control to a Life Lens based on interdependence and experimentation.

Our ecosystem includes:

**RADs** - contribution recognition in collaborative environments. 

**rProtocols** – open, evolving patterns that enable transparency and distributed trust.

**rCollabs** – peer-owned collaboratives blending corporate and cooperative DNA.

**rSparks** – community startup labs for launching new collaboratives.

Together, these initiatives prototype a new model of coordination where work serves life.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

This repository contains the **AT Protocol** integration of rProtocols — a technical foundation for decentralized, versioned, and forkable protocols.
It includes:

* Definitions of **Needs** and **Protocols** as linked entities.

* Versioning and cryptographic integrity using DIDs.

* Support for **Follow** and **Adopt** relationships (social validation).

* Structures for **open editing**, **forking**, and **evolution**.

Each protocol is treated as an experiment — transparent, traceable, and adaptable.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

* **Life Serves Life** – All collaboration exists to meet life’s needs.

* **Life as Experiment** – Every protocol is a hypothesis to be tested and improved.

* **Voluntary Adoption** – Alignment arises through choice, not enforcement.

* **Transparency and Peer Review** – Trust grows through openness, not hierarchy.

* **Evolution and Forking** – Diversity of practice is a strength, not a flaw.

## 🤝 Contribute

rProtocols are built to evolve through participation.
You can:

* Suggest improvements or extensions.

* Fork and adapt protocols for your own context.

* Share your results so others can learn from them.

Every contribution — code, writing, insight, or experiment — helps refine our shared understanding of how to collaborate **with life, not against it**.
