rProtocols

rProtocols are living, open protocols for collaboration — transparent, adaptable ways of working that evolve through collective experimentation rather than static rules.
They help individuals, teams, and communities create alignment without control, building a foundation for a Life-serving, peer-to-peer economy.

A protocol in this context is not just technical — it’s social, organizational, and experimental.
Each protocol defines how something is done, why it exists (the need it serves), and how it can adapt through feedback and iteration.
Protocols can be adopted, forked, and evolved openly — like recipes, trails, or open-source software — forming an ecosystem of shared learning.

🌍 Part of the Radical World Ecosystem

Radical World is a collaborative experiment to reimagine how we organize, work, and create — moving from a Story Lens based on ownership and control to a Life Lens based on interdependence and experimentation.

Our ecosystem includes:

rCollabs – peer-owned collaboratives blending corporate and cooperative DNA.

rProtocols – open, evolving patterns that enable transparency and distributed trust.

rCommunity – local networks offering life-serving services and collaboration opportunities.

rSparks – community startup labs for launching new collaboratives.

rBucks – a community currency for local exchange.

Together, these initiatives prototype a new model of coordination where work serves life.

🧩 What’s Inside

This repository contains the AT Protocol integration of rProtocols — a technical foundation for decentralized, versioned, and forkable protocols.
It includes:

Definitions of Needs and Protocols as linked entities.

Versioning and cryptographic integrity using DIDs.

Support for Follow and Adopt relationships (social validation).

Structures for open editing, forking, and evolution.

Each protocol is treated as an experiment — transparent, traceable, and adaptable.

🧠 Core Concepts

Life Serves Life – All collaboration exists to meet life’s needs.

Life as Experiment – Every protocol is a hypothesis to be tested and improved.

Voluntary Adoption – Alignment arises through choice, not enforcement.

Transparency and Peer Review – Trust grows through openness, not hierarchy.

Evolution and Forking – Diversity of practice is a strength, not a flaw.
